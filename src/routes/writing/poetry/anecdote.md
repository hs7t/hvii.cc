I once — for an instant, just a second— <br>
managed, somehow, to think <br>
that I’d forgotten you. And, trembling, I scrambled <br>
to comb through whatever you’d left of me — <br>
every stolen kiss, every soft word, every gesture <br>
that’d ever made me think we soured; <br>
every time you’d told me “I love you” <br>
and I didn’t know what to say back; that one day<br>
that I kissed your face <br>
and hit you with my nose, and apologized <br>
and fled running <br>
before having to run back for my keys.

And I found you there, <br>
in the bits and pieces, just slightly dried <br>
by time.

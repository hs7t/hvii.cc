Guns ring afar<br>
like popping corn;<br>
“It's not fireworks,”<br>
states my mother.

Two parties,<br>
or three or more;<br>
their noise settles<br>
in a matter of minutes.

A metal door shuts<br>
as the storekeeper closes<br>
and climbs up the stairs<br>
up to her home.

The TV is back on,<br>
“We’ll watch the news tomorrow;”<br>
thirty minutes pass<br>
and shots click again<br>
above the programme's voices.

It all crumbles into fine soft sands; \
As the breeze thickens and sweeps me past \
Good things wither when they grace my hands.

I try to thread careful through time's vast lands, \
Yet as much as I count each blessing I'm cast, \
It all crumbles into fine soft sands. \

The voices of guides and beloved friends \
Ring loudly and clearly before fading fast; \
Good things wither when they grace my hands.

Though I wish I could weave each of these strands \
Into a colourful fabric of life I've passed, \
It all crumbles into fine soft sands.

And when I tire of the tides’ demands \
I look behind to an horizon hazed, not glassed; \
Good things wither when they grace my hands.

Far enough, when the storm lands, \
the dust will find me to settle at last. \
It all crumbles into fine soft sands; \
Good things wither when they grace my hands.

# hvii.cc

My personal website! Built as a static site with SvelteKit. Includes
sections for poetry, projects and pictures! Created with a lot of help
from Josh Collinsworth's
[awesome guide](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog)

## Tech used

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [MDsveX](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX) and
  [adapter-static](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.dev/) and
  [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) and
  [imagesloaded](https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/)

## Running this yourself

1.  Reconsider. Why would you want to do this? No. Use a template. Follow
    [Josh's guide](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog).
    Be kind to yourself.

2.  Clone this repo, and install all the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/hs7t/hviicc.git
    $ npm i
    ```
3.  Run a development server:

    ```
    $ npm run dev
    ```

4.  Get a build when you're ready:
    ```
    npm run build   # check out ./dist afterward!
    ```

## About

This project has been on my mind for a while! It was initially
created for week 6 of Hack Club's [Siege](https://siege.hackclub.com/)
